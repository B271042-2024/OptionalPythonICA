DESCRIPTION:
Analysis focuses on protein conservation in a certain taxonomic group, comparing a group of organisms listed in the input fasta file.
1	A copy of fasta file was made.	[output: aves_copy.fasta]
2	Sequences were cleaned to produce 2 lines per sequence and then, filtered. (optional: with tags 'PREDICTED' and/or 'LOW QUALITY PROTEIN')
	[output: aves_edited.fasta (cleaning/re-formatted: 1 line=title, 1 line=sequences) & aves_filtered.fasta (filtered sequences)]
3	Sequences were aligned with ClustalO.	[output: aves.aln]	(MODE: --force --threads=30)
4	Aligned sequences were re-formatted using EMBOSS showalign to produce files below:
		- Re-formats.	[output: aves_original.aln] (MODE: -show=a)
		- Shows identical sequences. (based on sequence comparison)	[output: aves_identity.aln] (MODE: -show=i)
		- Generates non-identical report. (based on sequence comparison) 	[output: aves_nonidentity.aln] (MODE: -show=n)
		- Generates similarity report. (based on function/biochemical)	[output: aves_similarity.aln] (MODE: -show=s)
		- Generates dissimilarity report. (based on function/biochemical)	[output: aves_dissimilarity.aln] (MODE: -show=d)
5	Protein conservation plot was generated using EMBOSS plotcon.	[output: aves_plotcon.png & aves_plotcon.data]
6	Motif search was done against PROSITE database using EMBOSS patmatmotif.	[output: aves.motif]
